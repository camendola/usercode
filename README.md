## Tools for dumping CMS database payloads

#### Package contents
   * a `conddb_dumper` executable that can be used to dump (mostly ECAL)
     conditions in txt files from a given object-specific tag, with several options
   * a general plugin for dumping several conditions at the same time/run
     from a given Global Tag, via cmsRun + configuration file.
   * a general plugin for dumping ECAL events for closer inspection
   * some utilities developed for the monitoring of the ECAL laser monitoring corrections

#### Dumper list
   * `conddb_dumper.cpp`: self-explicative via the `-h/--help` options. Currently supported objects: 
     * BeamSpotObjects
     * ESEEIntercalibConstants
     * ESGain
     * ESIntercalibConstants
     * EcalADCToGeVConstant
     * EcalChannelStatus
     * EcalClusterLocalContCorrParameters
     * EcalGainRatios
     * EcalIntercalibConstants
     * EcalIntercalibConstantsMC
     * EcalLaserAlphas
     * EcalPFRecHitThresholds
     * EcalPedestals
     * EcalPulseCovariances
     * EcalPulseShapes
     * EcalSamplesCorrelation
     * EcalTPGLinearizationConst
     * EcalTPGLutGroup
     * EcalTPGLutIdMap
     * EcalTPGPedestals
     * EcalTPGSlidingWindow
     * EcalTPGSpike
     * EcalTPGWeightGroup
     * EcalTPGWeightIdMap
     * EcalTimeCalibConstants
     * EcalTimeOffsetConstant
     * RunInfo
   * `lava_db.cpp`: validate a tag of the ECAL monitoring corrections
   * `lava_text.cpp`: validate a set of ECAL monitoring corrections starting from a txt file with dumped-corrections
   * `lava_db_compare.cpp`: compare two tags of ECAL monitoring corrections, by
                            matching the IOV of one tag to the closest IOV of
                            the other tag
   * `lava_db_cond.cpp`: (superseded) for ECAL monitoring corrections, compare the content
                         of a tag to the content of another tag, by matching
                         the IOV of one tag to the closest IOV of the other tag
   * `lava_db_dumpId.cpp`: dump ECAL monitoring correction histories for a given set of DetId (or all of them)
   * `lava_db2txt.cpp`: convert the content of ECAL monitoring corrections to a txt file
   * `lava_db2root.cpp`: convert the content of ECAL monitoring corrections to a root file
   * `merge_dump.cpp`: merges different txt files of ECAL monitoring
                       corrections with overlapping IOV into one single
                       coherent txt file (N.B. does not need the CMSSW environment to work)

#### Dumper setup
Setup a working area for example in `CMSSW_10_1_10`. Any release `>=10XY`
should work just fine, contact me in case not. For older releases please refer to the branches
`cmssw_9x`, `cmssw_8x`, and `cmssw_7x`, for `CMSSW_9X`, `CMSSW_8X`, and `CMSSW_7X` respectively.
Please note that not all the objects supported in the latest release are backported.
```bash
cmsrel CMSSW_10_1_10
cd CMSSW_10_1_10/src
cmsenv
git cms-init
git clone git@github.com:ferriff/usercode.git
git cms-merge-topic -u ferriff:ecal_calib_tools # works with some apparently harmless errors
cd usercode/
scram b
```

Example: how to dump an object from the default Frontier DataBase
```bash
conddb_dumper -O EcalIntercalibConstants -t EcalIntercalibConstants_2012ABCD_offline
```
